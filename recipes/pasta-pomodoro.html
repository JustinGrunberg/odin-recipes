        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Pasta Pomodoro is a classic Italian dish featuring a simple yet flavorful tomato sauce. <br>
            It typically includes fresh tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and basil. The sauce is simmered <br>
            until rich and slightly thickened, then tossed with al dente pasta, often spaghetti or penne. <br>
            The dish is finished with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and fresh basil, creating a light, fresh,<br>
             and aromatic meal that's a staple of Italian home cooking.</p>
